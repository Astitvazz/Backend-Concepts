Hii , I am Astitva. I have been learning javaScript, Nodejs , MongoDB , Express etc for last one year. In this Repository I have applied basics of Node js , Express to build a server and Restful Api for Student Management System. Here, are some of the 
routes I have created. 

1)- To get all the students enrolled

NOTE: here I have not connected MongoDB for simplicity, I am using dummy json data as database. T have also avoided mvc pattern for making it simple and easy for beginners.
